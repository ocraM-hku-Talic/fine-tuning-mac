{"prompt": "Why might abductive reasoning not always be accurate?", "completion": "Abductive reasoning doesn\u2019t guarantee absolute accuracy because it relies on the most probable explanation. It could miss other possible explanations that aren't considered, such as genetic factors contributing to Victoria's traits beyond a single ancestor."}
{"prompt": "What are the key responsibilities of directors in relation to internal controls as mentioned in the material?", "completion": "Directors are required to set up and maintain a system of internal controls over financial matters, including transactions, disbursements, and investments. Their duties include preventing errors or fraudulent acts and ensuring accurate information is provided to shareholders for auditing purposes."}
{"prompt": "How can a breach of contract coexist with negligence in the same factual scenario?", "completion": "A breach of contract can coexist with negligence if the facts supporting the contract also give rise to a cause of action in tort. For example, as discussed in Donoghue v Stevenson, a railway passenger can sue either for breach of the contract (if they relied on it) or for negligence if they were injured due to the defective condition of the train. The same set of facts may allow different individuals to bring claims under both contract and tort laws.  \n\n---"}
