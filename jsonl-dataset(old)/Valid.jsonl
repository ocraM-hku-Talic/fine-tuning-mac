{"prompt": "Why is it important to consider the \"avenue of approach\" when determining whether a breach of contract claim applies?", "completion": "The \"avenue of approach\" refers to how one might first think about bringing a claim, such as starting with a breach of contract rather than tort. However, in cases like Donoghue v Stevenson, it is often necessary to consider if the claim can also be brought under tort (e.g., negligence) instead of contract law. For instance, if a retailer and manufacturer have a contract, but the consumer has no legal right to sue under that contract, they may need to explore other avenues, such as claiming negligence or strict liability for breach of promise if applicable. This is why it's important to consider alternative approaches when analyzing a factual scenario."}
